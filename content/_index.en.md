Fraxinus is a compact 3D printer for home and small workshop use.  
Although it is compact, it still retains the high-speed capabilities thanks to its CoreXY design.  
Currently, we are developing 5 models with print sizes of 70mm³, 170mm³, 220mm³, 310mm³ and 510mm³.  
There are aloso [enclosure version](/en/docs/enclosure/) and [trident version](/en/docs/trident/).

Fraxinus is being developed and tested on the Discord community.
