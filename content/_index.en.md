Fraxinus is a compact 3D printer for home and small workshop use.  
Although it is compact, it still retains the high-speed capabilities thanks to its CoreXY design.  
Currently, we are developing two models with print sizes of 170mm³ and 220mm³.

Fraxinus is being developed and tested on the Discord community.
